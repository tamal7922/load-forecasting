# load-forecasting
two main studies are conducted to compare the predictive capabilities
of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) in
electricity load forecasting. We propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural
network-based framework, which is the latest and one of the most popular techniques of deep
learning, to tackle this tricky issue. The proposed framework is tested on a publicly available
load data of 5112 hours. The accuracy criterion used is the Mean Absolute Percentage of
Error (MAPE). The results show that the RNN model can make good predictions.
MAPE for RNN-LSTM model is 36.994% compared to ANN model is 53.897% over 488
test samples which show a significant improvement in case of RNN-LSTM method of load forecasting.
